# Katoomba

Read a ServiceCatalographer instance and create a report for each service.

Currently, this is geared towards reading BiodiversityCatalogue and reporting
to the BioVeL Wiki.

It requires Python 3 and the Python requests package.

Change to the directory containing this README file, and run using:
```
./katoomba
```
